  <p>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, which is one of the two fundamental ideas in the field of physics along with quantum mechanics.</p>
  <p>He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect and made significant contributions to the development of quantum mechanics.</p>
  <p>Einstein is best known for his equation <em>E=mcÂ²</em>, which demonstrates the equivalence of mass and energy, and for his groundbreaking work on the general theory of relativity.</p>
  <p>He was not only a brilliant scientist but also an outspoken advocate for peace, civil rights, and scientific freedom.</p>
